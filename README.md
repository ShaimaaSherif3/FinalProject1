This project utilizes machine learning to predict whether a Near-Earth Object (NEO) is hazardous. 
The dataset contains observations of asteroids tracked by NASA from 1910 to 2024.

## ðŸ“Œ Dataset Source
The dataset used in this project is publicly available on Kaggle:

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview
- *Dataset*: NASA's NEO data (1910-2024)
- *Algorithm Used*: Random Forest Classifier
- *Model Accuracy*: 86.5%
- *Key Features for Prediction*:
  - absolute_magnitude: Brightness of the asteroid
  - estimated_diameter_max: Maximum estimated diameter (in km)
  - relative_velocity: Speed of the asteroid (in km/s)
  - miss_distance: Distance from Earth (in km)
